This was a mini card game in python where you are trying to guess the random choosen disney character 
by choosing the options on left that has options for their apparences or their accessories.
This was a group project from grade 11 python class
which we presented to the whole class and game used to be bug-free and was perfectly working,
it might have a missing file now since it has some errors while running 
but it would take so much time to debug it so I just left it since I dont remember my own code anymroe.
